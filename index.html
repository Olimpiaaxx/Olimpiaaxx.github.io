        <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Olimpia. I graduated from Tourism Management a couple of months before the worldwide pandemic in 2020 so as you can imagine the timing wasn't great! I had to come up with another plan for my career and came across KidsCanCode channel on YouTube that teaches you to code in Python by using a little turtle called Fred and I fell in LOVE! It took me about 6 months of learning the basics at home to get my first full-time position at Elsevier as a frontend developer to work on a product used by almost 500k unique users each week. I now have 3 years of experience in TypeScript, React, and Redux, and a great understanding of testing and accessibility principles.</p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>

          <h4>Mendeley Cite at Elsevier</h4>
          <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">May 2021 - March 2024</h5>
          <p>
            Mendeley Cite provides a referencing tool for researchers and students to help with their publications. It is a Microsoft Word add-in feature written in Typescript and uses React, and Redux frameworks.
          </p>

          <h4>Testing Strategy at Elsevier</h4>
          <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">October 2022 - March 2024</h5>
          <p>I took the role of a Testability Champion within my team and as part of that, I came up with an initiative to introduce a better testing strategy. To do so, I have asked two of my colleagues to join me in discovering and developing a better approach. One of the first steps was to figure out current bad habits and a way to encourage the team to learn better ways. I have set up numerous workshops with my colleagues to come up with a guide that would sum up the improvement strategy and introduce a playground repository where the 3 of us have worked on examples of bad and good code.  

          We worked on each testing layer at a time, and once we were happy with the proposal, I would then set up workshops with the whole team to share our findings, and plans and have group coding sessions ensuring that each member of the team is on the same page. This allowed the team to ask questions, clarify any unknowns, and practice together.  
            
          In addition to the official documentation, I have also created a monthly newsletter that I have shared not only with my team but the wider company to showcase our achievements and spread the knowledge. 
            
          To ensure that my team could trust my judgment, I have taken additional courses to better understand current best practices and approaches to testing, such as Testing JavaScript by Kent C. Dodds.
